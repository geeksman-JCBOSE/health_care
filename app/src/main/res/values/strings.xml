SELFEL is not just an app but a treatment for every individual that faces the problem of stress.</string>

    <string name="data"> Stress is a mental health condition that\'s triggered by a terrifying event â€” either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.

Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD.

Getting effective treatment after stress symptoms develop can be critical to reduce symptoms and improve function.</string>
